## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hello and Welcome!
As I'm doing data science, Python, web scraping, APIs, modeling, Git, GitHub, and all the other tons of cool stuff, I will be updating this webpage with links to my projects, posts, etc. in hopes you will make use of it and help you on your journey.
<br /> Also, because I think it will be beneficial to have a quick reference. 


[A Web Scraping Project](https://hayatoumy.github.io/webscraping-1/)





You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hayatoumy/hayatoumy/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hayatoumy/hayatoumy/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
