## Hello and Welcome!

As I'm doing data science projects using Python, web scraping, APIs, AWS, Git, GitHub, and all the other tons of cool stuff, I will be updating this webpage with links to my projects, posts, etc. in hopes you will make use of it and help you on your journey.
<br /> Also, because I think it will be beneficial to have a quick reference.
