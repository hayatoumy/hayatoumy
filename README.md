## Hello and Welcome!

I am an enthusiastic data scientist and a statistician, with passion for Machine Learning and data modeling. I much enjoy creating efficient, easy-to-use solutions for challenging problems. 

As I'm doing different data science projects using Python, web scraping, APIs, AWS, Git, GitHub, and all the other tons of cool stuff, I will be updating this webpage with links to my projects, posts, etc. in hopes you will make use of it and help you on your journey.
<br /> Also, because I think it will be beneficial to have a quick reference. 
<br /> You can message me at [My LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haya-toumy/)
